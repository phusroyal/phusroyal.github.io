abstract: >-
  We enhanced fine-grained NER performance for English and Bangla in SemEval-2023 by augmenting limited training data using BabelNet and Wikipedia redirections,
  and training mDeBERTa models on this enriched data. Our approach significantly outperformed baseline systems, achieving notable macro-F1 improvements in both 
  languages.
